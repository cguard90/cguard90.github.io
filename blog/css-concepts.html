      <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>
          If that's not a title that will thrill you, I don't know what is. So this week we have been introduced / reintroduced depending on experience level to CSS. Generally speaking, I like CSS, but I'm writing about positioning because to me, it's the part of CSS that makes the least sense given the terminology they use. So to get the confusing part out of the way, lets identify the different types of positioning. There are four types: relative, fixed, absolute, and static. The names seem pretty simple. So let's talk about what makes this confusing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Relative positioning is the positioning of an object relative to where it would have been otherwise. This basic concept is what is throwing me off. It is not placed relative to what else is on the page, but it's based off of where it would be otherwise. This is considered to be in the normal flow of the document, so it won't overlap other items that should be appearing in this space, however it can be overwritten / blocked by other elements on the page. So now I've used a couple more technical phrases... so what is the flow? lets look.
        </p>

          <div class="css_container">
            <img src="../imgs/ex1.png">
          </div>

        <p>
          So in this example, 4 divs were created. I have erased all their positioning instructions except for their relative positioning. This means that they show up in the order they are written, placed one after the other vertically. And that's essentially at a high level, the flow. If I change the positioning on any of these so that it's considered 'out of the flow' then it would no longer appear in that stack. So it would look like this:
        </p>
          <div class="css_container">
            <img src="../imgs/ex2.png">
          </div>

        <p>Or this:
        </p>

          <div class="css_container">
            <img src="../imgs/ex3.png">
          </div>

        <p>
          So why is it an or? In the first example, I positioned it on the right so that you could see all of the relative elements collapse together when something is removed from the flow of the document. However if the removed element isn't told to go somewhere else, then it will sit overtop of the relative elements. So always think of relative as relative to the flow of the elements. If an element is removed from the flow, it must be accounted for appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is a position type that removes an element from a flow? One is absolute positioning. For absolute positioning, you tell the element where to go, regardless of what else is on the page. Why is this beneficial? It is beneficial becuase it allows you to place items on the page, rather than arrange the items. For sidebars, or maybe something you want to ensure doesn't move if the screen is resized, this is a good option.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another option for a position type that will not be moved is fixed. a fixed item will stay in place even if the page is scrolled, and this is the primary difference between absolute and fixed positioning. a good example of this is pop-up adds. Think of a page where you have visited, and scrolled down, and a pop up ad comes up. You scroll down, and it moves with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Static positioning is the last position type, and it is used less than the other 4 types. Static position types are not effected by commands in relation to the top, bottom, right, or left of the page. They are essentially going to leave the items where they are according to the normal flow of the page. So in this example, even though I've instructed Div1 to be in the top left corner of the page, static doesn't follow these instructions, because it's keeping the element in the normal flow of the page.
        </p>

          <div class="css_container">
            <img src="../imgs/ex4.png">
          </div>

        <p>
          I do hope this review was helpful. I can honestly say that I now have a better understanding of how each positioning type works as a result of writing this. That said, I have some fixing to do on my blog... so I suppose we'll see if you read this before or after I make those changes.
