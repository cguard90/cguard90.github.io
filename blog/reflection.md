    What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
For me the bigger part of this challenge was positioning, rather than margin borders and padding. I will say I did prefer to leave in a border while working on the shape of the page, so that way I knew which elemenet was taking up how much space in exactly which location.

    What did you learn about CSS positioning?
That I need to practice with it a lot more. I used several types of positioning in my document, based on how they effected the layout. I used absolute, fixed, and relative. Still will need to use them more and research them a bit more / discuss them to speed up my judgement on which to use.

    What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?
Color for me is by far the easiest, but I saved that until the end. Probably because it's a such a small scale thing and I was worried more about the structural layout than the color scheme. I did think about skipping on colors altogether, but I didn't think that would look awesome.

    What was most difficult?
Positioning for me is the most difficult, it's rather fussy. However I am improving at it, so it is getting better. A few more CSS practices and I'll be moderatley comfortable with it I think.

    What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
That it's important to utilize classes from the beginning before you implement your css (rookie mistake). Because I didn't use classes it made it really impractically difficult (for now) to go back and add them. I had so many rules inherited from the top that I really couldn't change many things without losing all those set rules and starting from scratch, so I just left it. It was definitely a lesson learned.
