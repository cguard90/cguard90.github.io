      Version Control is a very interesting concept, and an extremely useful tool once you become proficient with it. I would not yet say I'm proficient with it, but most people aren't when they just begin learning something. Today is my first day heavily using Git, despite having an brief introduction to it a month ago. There are many different ways to describe what Git is, and many diagrams too. Essentially Git tracks every change made to every branch and gives you the option to merge the branches back together to the main branch. The main line is called the Master branch. Merging to the master branch should only be done when it can be confirmed that the contents of the code are bug free. Because Git allows multiple people to work on different parts of the code simultaneously,it can be a useful tool for dividing tasks between programmers, while making sure all parts integrate correctly before releasing a finished product.

        How does Git do this? By tracking a series of save points, which it calls commits. A commit can be done at any point in time on any of the branches, and they are tracked seperately from the Master branch, until they are ready to be merged. Commits contain the most vital information you need when collaborating on a project: Who made what changes, when they made them, and what the changes were. GitHub is one site that allows you to store those commits, and it shows both contents that have been removed, which show in red; and contents that have been added, which show in green. Everything shown in white is carried over from the previous commit.

        This makes GitHub a great place to store your code, because it is both simple to use, and simple to read through the changes. The color coding will draw your eyes to the updates, and if there are any issues in attempting to merge your commit, the site will let you know. While learning to work with Git and GitHub I personally encountered a few stumbling blocks. For one, I pushed a commit to my Master, when I didn't start from the most up to date version of my code. This cause the site to tell me that my commits didn't line up and that my code was two commits behind what I was attempting to change. I was able to practice this a few more times throughout the day, so I have been able to iron out some of the early kinks. As I'm now in DBC, I will have plenty more time to keep working Git and GitHub, and learn so much more about it's uses.
