      <h1>Online Security</h1>
        <p>
          Online Security is a topic to me that I find very interesting. Some of these reasons are the fact that I try to post minimal information about myself online (ironic now that I have a blog page), and I know some people are so into social media that their entire lives are posted on the internet. There are many stories of both people being successful and being harassed just based solely on what they have posted. There are several issues as I see it with online security based on readings that I have done.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first issue is the fact that with the internet, literally all computers connected to the internet are in a sense connected to each other. This is relating to a post I read from CNN a little while back. Pretty much what it said is that no matter how many firewalls you put up, or security settings you apply, if someone wants to find the information badly enough, it can be found. There is no truly guaranteed security online. This can be evidenced by the Ashley Madison Hacks, and the head of the CIA having his email hacked. There is always a way into a program, even if the programmers themselves overlook it.

          The other reason online security is of such an interest to me is small stories like <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/kiki-kannibal-the-girl-who-played-with-fire-20110415">Kiki Kannibal</a> as an example. I also think it's kind of crazy the things people will do with the anonymity. But personal information is being distributed unknowingly or stolen on the internet all the time. The only time people seem to worry about it is if it happens to millions of people at once, or some corporate or government institution gets hacked. There's really no shortage of articles on the subject.

        <p>
          The funny thing about online security to me though, is that there are firms out there for <a href ="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/54434/white-hat-hacker">white hat hackers</a>. They do good work in improving security, but on an international level I'm not sure if there is enough global presence for white hat hackers. Additionally, all the <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/82636.html"> international</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/14/technology/security/russia-hackers/index.html">hacks</a> make it seem like this is going to be a long up-hill battle for information on the internet to be truly safe.

          On the bright side, at least we now know how to make the <a href-"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-perfect-password-20151023-story.html">perfect password</a>.
