      <h1>Reflection on the Blog</h1>
        <p>
          So as we wrap up phase 0, I think the blog has actually been a good instrument from actively coding, and taking time to learn about particular elements within code, or a coding language. I've honestly liked it because I took it as time to dive into concepts I found challenging, and breaking them down to teach others has also increased my understanding of that particular topic. I also liked being able to see what other people were implementing for their personal sites, and some people were much more ambitious with their html & css than I have been at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there was anything I disliked, I was worried about posting on a topic and being told I was totally wrong on everything I said. A lot of times I kept my sources up until I finished typing. This didn't end up being a bad thing, becuase I wanted to convey correct information. The only other downside is that I've had a number of other things going on which kept me from diving into certain topics as deeply as I'd like. I do plan on changing this once I get onsite. I also do plan on updating the blog throughout phase 1 & 2 and maybe 3 to practice skills, or just to give myself a change of pace on a weekend. I'm not sure if this is necessarily an obtainable goal, but I will try my best to stick by it. I also would like to learn how to use bootstrap, as I wasn't able to do so this week.
        </p>

        <p> Overall, I do have a much better idea at the how production process works, although I obviously don't understand the process as a whole quite yet. I'm looking forward to writing more advanced code and cleaner code, and that include HTML and CSS as well as Ruby and JavaScript.
