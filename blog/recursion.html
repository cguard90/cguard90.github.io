      <h1>Recursion</h1>
        <p>
          At the absolute highest level, A recursive function is a function that calls itself. There are several other conditions that make a condition recursive. A recursive solution is generally solving a larger problem by breaking it down into small steps, and having those steps until the problem is solved. These small steps, at their smallest level are called base cases. A base case can be a small value, or even an empty value, such as an empty array.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this sounds like iteration, they are actually kind of similar. The biggest difference is that a recursive solution depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. From what I can tell, recursion can also be more efficient on larger scaled data sets, but this is also highly dependent on what the code is attempting to accomplish.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest example I found of recursion, in a plain english exampel is the following: </br>
          If home, stop moving.</br>
          else, take one step</br>
          This is a good example in english of breaking things down to their smallest steps. The condtion once met, is to stop taking steps, otherwise, only one step is taken.</br></br>
          The last real life example I found for recursion was an example of setting 2 mirrors across from each other. The image will reflect infinitely, recursion can repeat infinitely as well, which is why it is important to set a condition to break at.
