      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Just a little bit about Myself. I'm 25, I've lived in Florida since I graduated from Wells College (if you have heard of it let me know, it would be a surprise) with a degree in philosophy. I had originally moved here to work as Mortgage Loan Officer. After about a year and a half of that, I moved to business Banking with Bank of America. A few months after I started at the bank, I started rock climbing as a hobby, so while at DBC in New York there is a climbing gym in Brooklyn I'd like to check out once if I have time. I started learning code about September of 2014. I started to get a bit more serious about learning code in January 2015, and that pretty much brings me to today. If you want to find out me personally, you can see me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chris.guard.75">Facebook</a>.
        </p>

          For the pre-college stuff, I'm originally from Niagara Falls, New York. People from my hometown have told me I talk more like a Canadian though (although I don't say 'eh?'). I developed a fear of heights somewhere along the way, which I think makes rock climbing the perfect hobby for me (sometimes). Other hobbies I have had include playing music. I know how to play cello, although I haven't been doing that much while in Florida. I really enjoy playing music but haven't had much time for it recently. I can also play electric Bass, Guitar, and a very little bit of Piano. I picked up swimming late in high school, and swam throughout college as well.

          My goals for DBC are to ultimately find a job as a dev in either Seattle, Boston, DC, or Denver. I've never been to Seattle but I think it looks like a terrific place. I did visit the Denver area earlier this year (after being accepted into DBC) to see if I would like living there. I thought the area was amazing. A friend of mine who completed the DBC program works as a dev in Boston, so it would be nice to move somewhere where I already know people and that is part of the appeal of that area. For DC, I have cousins that live a little outside of the DC area, so I wouldn't mind living there either.

          To see the coding I've done while in DBC, I invite you to check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/cguard90">GitHub</a>. I haven't pushed any of the things I worked on prior to the program becuase I want to keep them seperate for the time being. You can also take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAMAABPuv9kBIzdheR_0GVm7RlnXOp35gfqBEU8&trk=hp-identity-name">LinkedIn</a> profile, Although I'm not very active on it.

    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      It was good fun, I think it's interesting how different resources for code
      appeal to different people at different times. I'll definitely be
      exploring html doctor (might be off on the name there) more as a result of
      the paired challenge, before I had saved it but didn't get inclined to
      read it unless I needed it.


    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
      Somewhat helpful, I think wireframing is alright, so far we're not making
      anything too crazy though. The biggest aspect I think wireframing helps
      with is accounting for all aspects of the page that you need to write the
      HTML for. This is pretty crucial I suppose, I'm sure as we get into CSS
      we'll be more happy to wireframe as well.


    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
      We actually designed the wireframe together, made sure it had all the
      content from the previous challenge, and then filled out the HTML from
      there. The important parts were mostly location of content, and what
      content should and shouldn't be on the page. Beyond that it was just
      discussion of layout options, and what other potential things we could /
      should account for. Mostly though I think we agreed it was just about
      setting up a guideline to follow.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
      I don't think we covered new symantic elements, but we did discuss spans,
      divs, prioritization for h1 h2 etc, but we didn't utilize anything new to
      me that was symantic on this challenge.
