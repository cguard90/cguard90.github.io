      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h1>Resume</h1>

      <header>
         <h1>Welcome to my blog page!</h1> <!-- just saying welcome, giving a beginning / header for just the text article. -->
            <p>this will be the blurb of text describing origins of coding, etc.</p>
            <p>this will be the paragraph for my goals and etc</p>
            <p>perhaps a brief outline of what can be found where, and a gist of what each could contain i.e. that personal will be divded into professional and personal sections</p>
      </header>
    </article> <!-- article & body & p - this is for the bulk of the text that will be appearing on the home page. article designates what type of content should be contained here (symmantic element!) and then p from what I've seen no longer needs to be contained within the body tags... If I'm wrong i'd like to find out now, it seems like a good time. -->

      <p>list names of people I've partnered with, talked about code with, taught me code, contributed to the blog... etc</p>
