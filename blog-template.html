    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      It was good fun, I think it's interesting how different resources for code
      appeal to different people at different times. I'll definitely be
      exploring html doctor (might be off on the name there) more as a result of
      the paired challenge, before I had saved it but didn't get inclined to
      read it unless I needed it.


    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
      Somewhat helpful, I think wireframing is alright, so far we're not making
      anything too crazy though. The biggest aspect I think wireframing helps
      with is accounting for all aspects of the page that you need to write the
      HTML for. This is pretty crucial I suppose, I'm sure as we get into CSS
      we'll be more happy to wireframe as well.


    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
      We actually designed the wireframe together, made sure it had all the
      content from the previous challenge, and then filled out the HTML from
      there. The important parts were mostly location of content, and what
      content should and shouldn't be on the page. Beyond that it was just
      discussion of layout options, and what other potential things we could /
      should account for. Mostly though I think we agreed it was just about
      setting up a guideline to follow.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
      I don't think we covered new symantic elements, but we did discuss spans,
      divs, prioritization for h1 h2 etc, but we didn't utilize anything new to
      me that was symantic on this challenge.
