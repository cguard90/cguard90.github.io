# cguard90.github.io

My DBC Phase 0 github pages site. This was the first website I had ever made. I am planning on bringing it up to date with more modern conventions, as well as utilizing bootstrap.

I have now started building a rails version of this site, so I have stripped it down quite a bit for now. It is pretty much just the structure. What is here as of commit 3880c473d095c9995790b2b74576ad15e2abdba6 was done in JFK airport while my flight was delayed with no internet connection. Their wifi was spotty, but I think I made it work well enough. It is by no means complete. Ideally I'd like to add the following features to this site, more for my convenience and practice than anything:
  1. Log_in (it will only add features for me, like an entries-new page)
  2. A page full of images, so that way I can select things that I think accurately highlight my personal life.
  3. Another search feature, because those are always fun.
  4. AJAX a couple small features.
  5. CSS is totally absent, I plan on utilizing bootstrap to make it look both modern and clean.
  6. New entries, I want to actually keep this up to track the things I learn as I learn them. Especially once I have a page to create new Entries, it should be easy for me to do.
